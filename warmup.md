# Warmup exercise: Heroku

## Goal

Your goal is to create a Heroku account, and to install the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) on
your computer. This will allow you to follow along with today's inline
exercises, and to quickly deploy your project apps to the Heroku cloud.

## What is Heroku?

Heroku is a "Platform as a Service" (PaaS) cloud host that offers free basic
accounts. Heroku makes it fast and easy to host your backend apps in the cloud
so that anyone, anywhere can access your apps--from e.g. a web browser or a
mobile app. This process is called "deployment." Heroku also integrates with
git, so the learning curve is not too steep.

## Instructions

1. Visit https://signup.heroku.com/ in your browser and fill out the form.
   Select "Node.js" as your primary development language. Click Create Free
   Account at the bottom.
1. Look for the verification email. Tap the link in this email, then set a
   password on the form. Tap "Set password and log in."
1. Go to https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli and download the Heroku CLI for your
   platform. Install it.
1. Go to command line. Type `heroku login` and enter your credentials to
   login.
1. Now that your account is created and the toolbelt is installed, begin the
   tutorial at
   https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs. Don't
   worry if you don't get very far, we'll continue this together.
